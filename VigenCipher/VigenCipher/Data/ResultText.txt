polymorphism allows methods to work with objects of different types,
enhancing the flexibility and extensibility of the code.
there are two types of polymorphism: static and dynamic.
abstraction helps to highlight common features of objects,
hiding unnecessary details and providing a simpler interface for working with objects.
